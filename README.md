# jQuery Playground

Using the `playground.html` file and a web console such as Firebug,
the jQuery Playground is a great place to experiment with jQuery
features.

# What to Play With

Here is what I suggest:

  1. Write some JavaScript in `behavior.js` so that when one of the
    `<li>` elements is clicked, it is removed from the DOM.

  2. Add more code to `behavior.js` so that when someone writes text
     into the form and presses the "Add" button a new `<li>` element
     is created with the text from the form.

  3. Make new `<li>` elements yellow for 2 seconds, then return them
     to normal.
